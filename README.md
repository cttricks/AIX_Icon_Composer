## What's the need fo this tool?
As it's very clear that this tool is tool is especially for extension developers making extensions (`.aix`) for app builders like App Inventor Niotron etc. A developer needs an icon for each of his/her extensions which he/she is making.  But most new developers don't know the proper size and way of implementing the icon. So this simple tool will help them in composing the icon of their choice in the correct size and format.

## Why base64 Image data?
Hosting an icon on any personal server, 3rd party server, or Google drive is a very common practice done by extension developers. But an extension developer must use Base64 image data instead of image URL in their extension. 
1. It doesn't require any server to host
2. No worries of broken links or server down 
3. The icon is always available to be displayed on any builder anytime

## Other Info ðŸŽ¯
1. You can use the icons on any of your extension for free and without attribution.
2. This site does not keep your images, all of them upload and get resized, compressed, and composed here on your device. We never upload images to our or any 3rd part site.
